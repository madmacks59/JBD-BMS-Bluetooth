#!/usr/bin/env python3
# This code should be run as SUDO as it does low level BLE scanning.
#
# Run it as follows:
#
#   sudo python jbd-bms-mqtt.py -n "Cabin 580ah" -i 0 -t solar
#   or
#   sudo python jbd-bms-mqtt.py -a "a4:c1:38:30:c2:8e" -i 0 -t solar
#
# This will scan for a bluetooth device called "Cabin 580ah" and extract its
# bluetooth address, or, use the passed address if provided, then try and attach
# to the BMS and read a set if variables, one time, and then publish a MQTT
# message with those variables to the Topic "solar".
#
# USAGE NOTE
# If you use a value other than 0 for the -i parm the program will loop forever
# and read the BMS values every X minutes based on the value you passed. This is
# not recommended as a long term method to run the script, as it could cause
# resource issues in the python environment. For an ongoing run please use a
# cron job to control run times and pass a 0 for the -i argument...
#
# In addition, if you run this program via a manual shell loop instead of using
# cron, and someone attached to the BMS using a bluetooth app (like XiaoxiangBMS
# or SmartBMSUtility) the code will fail when it attempts to connect (as the other
# app has the connection) and will throw an exception. If you started it intending
# it to run "forever" in a terminal window you will not realize it's failed.
#
# If cron is used, at least the process will be kicked off again based on the cron
# process and try to reconnect again, automatically...
#
# You've been warned!
